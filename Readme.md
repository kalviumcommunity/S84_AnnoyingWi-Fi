# Most Annoying Wi-Fi Names Around Me

## Project Overview
This project is a personalized platform where users can log in and maintain a list of the most annoying or weird Wi-Fi names they’ve encountered in their area. Each user can add, update, or delete entries in their list, making it a unique and interactive experience. The project blends humor with practicality while allowing me to apply and demonstrate all the concepts learned in the course.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Users will securely log in to access their lists.
- **Dynamic Lists**: Users can create and manage their personalized Wi-Fi name lists.
- **Database Integration**: All user-specific data will be stored in MongoDB for persistence.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for specific Wi-Fi names or sort them by categories (e.g., funniest, most annoying).
- **Responsive Frontend**: A clean and simple UI built with React for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema management)
- **Authentication**: Session storage for user credentials or optional Firebase Auth
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control, Bruno for API testing, and Postman for debugging

## Why This Project
I chose this project because it’s relatable, engaging, and connects with everyday experiences. Everyone has come across funny or irritating Wi-Fi names like “Loading… Please Wait” or “NoFreeWiFiHere.” Building this project will not only be entertaining but will also allow me to:
- Set up a full-stack development environment.
- Practice creating and managing APIs and databases.
- Work on user authentication and secure data handling.
- Design a fun and user-friendly React application.

This project makes learning the course concepts enjoyable and practical, helping me connect technical skills to real-world applications.
